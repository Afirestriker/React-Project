## React Tutorial

This tutorial is designed to teach you the Hooks in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

**Prerequisites:**
* Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS
* Basic knowledge of JavaScript (ES6)
* Basic knowledge of React


**Steps to creat React App:**
1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Create a new directory for your project.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
   1. `npx create-react-app <project-name>`
   2. `npm start` OR `npm run start`


**Steps to run existing React App:**
1. Download and install **Node.js** and **npm**
2. Download and install **Git**
3. Clone the repository. Use the `git clone` command, followed by the GitHub repository URL.
4. Navigate to the project directory. Use the command `cd <project-name>`
5. Install dependencies. Use the command `npm install`
6. Start the development server. Use the command `npm start`
7. Access the application. Typically the URL is **http://localhost:3000/**


**Tutorial:**
* Lesson 1 - React Hoooks - Introduction
  * Hooks are a new feature in React 16.8.
  * Hooks allow you to use React features without having to write a class. For example to use state you have to use Class Component
    but with the introduction to Hooks you can use State in Functional Components.
  * Hooks are JavaScript functions that let you "hook into" React features like state and lifecycle methods.
  * You can use hooks in any functional component.
  * There are three main reasons for hooks:
    1. **To avoid the confusion with the this keyword in JavaScript.**
      * Classes in React use the this keyword, which can be confusing for some developers. Hooks don't use classes, so they avoid this problem.
    2. **To make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components.**
       * With hooks, you can write reusable functions that contain stateful logic. This can make your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
    3. **To improve the organization of code within a component.**
       * Hooks allow you to split components into smaller, more focused functions. This can make your code easier to understand and debug.
